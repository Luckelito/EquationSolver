# Equation solver

This is a simple project for parsing and solving equations. Its main feature is the ability to handle order of operators and parenthesis.

## Implemented features
* Addition +
* Subtraction -
* Multiplication *
* Division /
* Parenthesis ()
* Equality = (does not really do anything interesting at the moment but will be used for calculating variables)

## How to use
Run the following:
```
javac *.java
java Main
```
and then just follow the instructions! 

Example equation:

(1 + 2 * 3) / (4 + 5) - 6

## TODO
* Improve parsing to handle non-standard input
* Save exact line number/index in syntax errors
* Add variables and more complex operators
